This repository provides replciation code for the methods outlined in
the arcticle,“Performance of Health Care Service Area Definitions for
Capturing Variation in Inpatient Care and Social Determinants of
Health.” Due to data restricted by DUAs and software licences in the
original study, this code draws exclusively on publicly avaialble data
to replicate the methods used to determine capture rates within a
geographic health care service area (HCSA).
